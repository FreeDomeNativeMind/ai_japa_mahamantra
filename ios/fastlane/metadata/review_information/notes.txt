This is a spiritual meditation app for japa practice with AI assistance. The app includes:

1. Traditional 108-bead mala counting
2. AI-powered spiritual guidance (requires local Ollama setup)
3. Progress tracking and statistics
4. Customizable notifications and reminders
5. Offline mode with local data storage

The app is designed for practitioners of Vaishnavism and traditional Hindu meditation. All data is stored locally on the device for privacy.

For testing the AI features, you may need to set up Ollama locally with the mozgach:latest model, but the app works fully offline without AI as well.
